<h3>ACADEMIC PROJECTS</h3>
<h4>M.Tech Thesis</h4>
<b>Title: Modelling and Analysis of Scatterer Interference in a Terahertz Networks</b>
<ul>
    <li><p>The aim of this thesis is to analyze <i><b>coverage probability, SINR, distribution of scatterer and Base Station(BS)
        interference</i></b> at the user by following different approaches using stochastic geometry framework.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Here we incorporated system model with impact of blockages, molecular noise, thermal noise, antenna beam misalignment
            methods, bounded pathloss model, highly directional antennas which are very crucial in determining scatterer and BS
            Interference.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>We proved that results of coverage probability and SINR that we have achieved for one of the derived analytical approximate
            approaches are similar to that of exact simulation approach.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>B.Tech Project: Image retrieval using feature extraction</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Aim is to retrieve images which are similar, by using Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) with Support Vector Machines
            (SVM) technique that follows geometric transform for retrieval of images.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
